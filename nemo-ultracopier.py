# ernzo:
# "This modification fixes the integration between Nemo and Ultracopier, and uses CopyQ to make the actual copy.
#
# Caveat is: Sometimes initally you'll need to perform the Copy/Paste operation twice because,
# the first time you run the script CopyQ will not be running (unless you launch it manually), and so it won't be able to capture the clipboard contents..
#
# The second time you perform Copy/"Paste with Ultracopier" copyq will be running, and the script will work as intended.
#
# It works allright here with:
# Debian (trixie) + KDE Plasma/Wayland + latest stock Nemo + Ultracopier + CopyQ.
# (Gnome and Mate are installed too but not running)
#
#
# -Btw this script was made by torturing ChatGPT for hours until it made it right, or almost.. 
# The first version did perform the copy/paste allright, but failed to launch CopyQ on its own, so it needed to be launched manually.
#
# Then I asked Copilot to fix the script, 
# and it made one that could launch copyq automatically on its own.. but failed to perform the actual copy/paste.
#
# So I went back to ChatGPT and asked to integrate one thing into the other..
# And well, this is the final result!
#
# All credits to the Original Developer/s, Lester,
# and ChatGPT + Copilot who did the rough work..
#
# This is probably not a definitive solution, 
# but maybe there's something we can learn about it, and can be implemented in a more definitive one."
